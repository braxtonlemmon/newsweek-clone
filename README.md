# Using Bootstrap project
Project based on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/using-bootstrap?ref=lnav) curriculum. The goal is to replicate [newsweek.com](https://www.newsweek.com/) using Bootstrap. As this is my first time using Bootstrap, I will be reading the framework docs to implement it into my design.
